#Goal:
To create a modern, lightweight, and maintainable release page that aligns with PHP’s identity—clean, developer-focused, and efficient.

#Design Approach:
This layout follows a mobile-first, content-first, and performance-oriented philosophy. It emphasizes readability, accessibility, and simplicity over visual clutter.

#Key Decisions:

Mobile-First & Fast – The CSS is written from the smallest viewport up, ensuring fast initial loads. Only system fonts are used—no external dependencies or images—keeping page weight minimal.

Simple & Maintainable – Vanilla HTML and CSS with clear semantic structure (<section>, <article>, <header>). Easy for future contributors to update content without touching layout logic.

Content-First Layout – Features, release notes, and download links are presented clearly in a stacked format on mobile and expand into a grid on larger screens.

On-Brand – Uses PHP’s recognizable purple-blue color palette and typographic hierarchy consistent with php.net styling.

Localizable & Accessible – All text is HTML-based (no embedded text in images). The markup supports language translation and screen readers.

Future-Ready – The structure can be reused for PHP 9.x or later with minor content updates—no layout rework needed.

#Outcome:
A small, clean, responsive release page that feels at home on php.net, prioritizing accessibility, developer-friendliness, and long-term maintainability.
